# Snapchat-Filter

In this project, Using libraries numpy, cv2 and pre-trained haarcascade models for face and eye detection, Making of filter that places a transparent sun-glasses of size propotional to face in live video stream recorded through web-cam was accomplished.

This project was learnt in Image-Processing SMP conducted by ISTE-NITK chapter.

## Objective
- To write a python code to create a filter which puts a sunglasses on your eyes.

## Components of Code 

- Import the required libraries : cv2,numpy
- Import the pre-trained models for face and eye detection
- Start video capture
- Detect faces on each frame of the captured video
- Find the bounding boxes
- Find facial landmarks
- Resize the glasses to match the face width
- Blend the glasses in the right position

### Operation:
-->Modify the path for sunglasses.png and voila!

-->Sometimes tweaking scale factor of detectMultiScale() will help If the code doesn't work. (imp: scalefactor>1 eg:1.05, 1.15, 1.2)

#### FAQs
-->What is an alpha channel? Normally, images have three channels: red, green, and blue. These denote the default color space; however, some images have a fourth channel, called the alpha channel, which denotes transparency.
-->When I drew the pair of sunglasses, I ensured it contained a transparent background. Normally, OpenCV would ignore this, but by passing -1 into the imread method, it reads this fourth channel.

-->Destination matrix conflict:While the eyes are detected, thereâ€™s no way of knowing the order of the eyes in advance. Sometimes the right eye will be detected first and sometimes the left eye will. To test, the x-coordinate is compared between the two eyes, and then the proper destination matrix can be composed.
